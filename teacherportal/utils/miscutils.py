Sorting/Searching Computational Complexity Analysis
---------------------------------------------------

**NOTE**: For 5MB+ of data in the testing, the request quantity would be too large for my MongoDB Atlas to handle (cloud services result in large delays when calling thousands 
of documents), so I generated a list of 15,000 dictionaries and sorted it for testing. Two trials were conducted for two different datasets. The file used to generate the data
and any results in this comment is testgen.py.

Bubble sort has two loops that iterate the inputted list (they are nested, so they multiply n elements x n elements), so it runs in O(n^2) time.
Empirical data: sorting data.txt took 37.799s and 40.303s

Selection sort also has two nested loops that iterate the inputted list, so it runs in O(n^2) time
Empirical data: sorting data.txt took 19.714s and 19.610s
The reason this method takes less time than bubble sort is that bubble sort swaps significantly more elements than selection sort, due to the nature of the algorithm. These
modifications to list values take more computational power and time.

The reason that these methods are slower than Python's .sorted() method is because of the algorithm Python uses, called "Timsort". The computational
complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn), which is significantly smaller than O(n^2). 
Empirical data: sorting data.txt took 1.003s and 0.095s

Linear search iterates the array once without nested loops, so in the worst case scenario it runs in O(n) time
Empirical data: searching took 0.080s and 0.072s

Binary search is a much more efficient method of searching an array, since it halves the search space with almost each iteration. This reducing quantity
of search space (n becomes n/2 becomes n/4 becomes n/8) can be modelled by a logarithmic function, and since we drop multiplicative constants when doing complexity analysis, we conclude
that binary search runs in O(logâ‚‚n). 
Empirical data: searching took <0.001s


Video Question Answers
----------------------
=> What do you notice about the searches that have the thin bars vs. those with the thicker bars?
    The sorting algorithms with thin bars are much quicker than the ones with thicker bars. Another trend I noticed is that the algorithms with thinner bars 
    break up the data into smaller sections and sort those out before creating a final sorted dataset.

=> Why would someone make this video?
    This video was created to show with visuals and audio how 15 different sorting algorithms function. It could have been made for educational purposes, or it could have been
    made because someone likes how sorting algorithms can be represented with visuals and audio.

=> Could this video be skewed to show something that is incorrect? How so?
    Absolutely; the description of the video states that speed and number of items is modified based on each algorithm's complexity, and that can impact how each algorithm's
    efficiency is conveyed to the audience. For example, the bubble sort algorithm has a much smaller dataset to sort when compared to the radix sort algorithms.
    Even though radix sorting is much more efficient, it takes longer in the video when compared to bubble sorting.
